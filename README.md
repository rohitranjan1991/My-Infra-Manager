# My Infra Manager  
  
My Infra Manager is a one stop solution to manage you Infrastructure on the go. The idea behind this is to be able to quickly debug, update, fix, you infrastructure from within the app so that you don't have to carry your desktop/laptop to everywhere you go for these tasks. Right now only iOS and Android versions are available, but the idea is to extend it to Desktop platforms as well.
  
## Features
